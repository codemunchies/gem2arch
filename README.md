rbt-packer
-----------

A converter that generates an ArchLinux PKGBUILD from a ruby gem.
This application is forked from [codemunchies/gem2arch](https://github.com/codemunchies/gem2arch).

## Why rbt-packer?

I found two scripts to create PKGBUILD automatically,
[codemunchies/gem2arch](https://github.com/codemunchies/gem2arch) and [codemunchies/gem2arch](https://github.com/codemunchies/gem2arch).

However, first gem has not been maintained during about 2 years,
and second script is not packed under general gem manner.

So rbt-packer gem aims to create a modern style PKGBUILD and frequently updating.
